This Notes application is like the Notes application in the MacOS.

Here you will not find the use of Redux/Flux and at the moment the function of long-term storage of notes is not implemented. I tried to make the development interesting for me, so I decided to use the minimum set of libraries, and also use new (not entirely new but still new) features from React, such as ReactHooks and ReactContext (I will use the context in future versions to create a possibility to switch between dark and light themes as at the moment in MacOS).

## TODO

- Create notes categories in separate list
- Add possibility to move notes trough categories
- Extend editor with Markdown feature with few tags
- Persist notes in local storage or using GraphQL server
- Think about CSS-in-JS lib for styles 
- Add a dark theme using React context

The Another React Notes App project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`
